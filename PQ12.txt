Governing the Coexistence of Execution Regimes

Abstract
This document formalizes the coordination of deterministic and proba-
bilistic execution domains within the Quantum Virtual Machine. While
field-native execution admits intrinsic nondeterminism and concurrency,
system-level operation often requires precise guarantees regarding re-
producibility, bounded variability, and controlled interaction between
execution regimes.
The chapter introduces coordination mechanisms through which QVM
governs the coexistence of deterministic and probabilistic domains with-
out altering underlying execution semantics. Determinism and proba-
bilism are treated as governance-level execution modes rather than as
properties of operators or fields themselves. QVM regulates their interac-
tion through domain configuration, contract activation, and admissibility
constraints.
Special attention is given to cross-domain interaction, where deterministic
and probabilistic domains must cooperate without contaminating each
other’s guarantees. The document formalizes coordination patterns,
boundary contracts, and audit implications arising from mixed-regime
execution. By doing so, it establishes a rigorous foundation for hybrid
field computing systems that combine exploration, optimization, and
verified execution within a single governed infrastructure.

This whitepaper builds directly upon the isolation, composition, and audit mechanisms developed
in previous chapters and prepares the ground for system-level field orchestration, economic
governance models, and practical deployment on classical computational infrastructure.

1 Deterministic Execution Domains
Deterministic execution domains in QVM are governance constructs that impose reproducibility
guarantees on field-native execution without modifying the underlying execution semantics.
Determinism is not treated as a property of operators, fields, or physical realization, but as a
domain-level obligation enforced through contracts and admissibility constraints.
A deterministic execution domain is defined as an execution domain Ddet in which all admissible
execution trajectories originating from an equivalent initial state class are required to be equivalent
under a specified equivalence relation. This relation may identify configurations that differ in
inessential structure while preserving the properties deemed relevant by governance policy.

Formally, let [s0] denote an equivalence class of initial execution states and let T (s0) denote
the set of all admissible execution trajectories originating from s0. The domain Ddet satisfies
determinism if for all trajectories

τ1, τ2 ∈ T (s0),
their terminal states are equivalent under the domain’s equivalence relation. This definition
permits intrinsic nondeterminism at the execution level while enforcing determinism at the
governance level.
Deterministic domains achieve this guarantee through contract activation rather than execution
control. Contracts may constrain operator selection, bound admissible nondeterminism, enforce
confluence properties, or require convergence to canonical representatives. These constraints
are evaluated as part of admissibility and cannot be bypassed by scheduling modulation or
concurrency.
Importantly, deterministic domains do not require serialization or centralized arbitration. Concur-
rent execution and parallel operator composition remain admissible as long as contract constraints
ensure equivalence of outcomes. Determinism is thus compatible with intrinsic parallelism and
does not imply a reduction to sequential execution.
Deterministic execution domains also define strong audit guarantees. Because outcome equivalence
is contractually enforced, execution traces may be reconstructed up to the defined equivalence
relation without ambiguity. This enables reproducible computation, verifiable results, and
regulatory compliance in contexts where exact repeatability is required.
Transition into or out of a deterministic execution domain is a governed act. Domain admission
requires verification that initial conditions satisfy all determinism contracts. Domain exit may
require additional verification to ensure that determinism guarantees are preserved up to the
transition boundary. Such transitions do not alter execution semantics but reconfigure governance
obligations.
By defining deterministic execution domains as governance-enforced equivalence guarantees, this
chapter establishes a precise and scalable notion of determinism for field-native computation.
Determinism becomes an explicit contract rather than an implicit assumption, providing a robust
foundation for coordination with probabilistic domains developed in subsequent chapters.

2 Probabilistic Execution Domains
Probabilistic execution domains in QVM are governance constructs that explicitly permit and
regulate nondeterministic field evolution. Unlike deterministic domains, which enforce equivalence
of outcomes, probabilistic domains treat variability as a first-class and intentional property of
execution. Probability is not introduced as randomness injected into execution, but as a governed
allowance of multiple admissible trajectories.
A probabilistic execution domain is defined as an execution domain Dprob in which admissible
execution trajectories from a given initial state class are permitted to diverge without requiring
convergence to an equivalent terminal configuration. The degree and nature of this divergence
are bounded by governance policies and execution contracts rather than left unconstrained.
Formally, let [s0] denote an equivalence class of initial execution states and let T (s0) denote the
set of admissible trajectories originating from s0. In a probabilistic domain, T (s0) is intentionally
non-singleton under the domain’s equivalence relation, and governance policies may attach
weights, bounds, or admissibility preferences to subsets of trajectories.
Probabilistic domains do not rely on external randomness sources or stochastic primitives.
Variability arises intrinsically from concurrent admissible operator compositions, structural
nondeterminism of the field, or exploratory admissibility modulation. Governance may optionally

introduce controlled stochastic selection mechanisms, but such mechanisms operate at the domain
boundary and do not alter execution semantics.
Contracts play a central role in regulating probabilistic execution. Rather than enforcing outcome
equivalence, contracts bound divergence, restrict pathological trajectories, and ensure that all
admissible outcomes satisfy required safety, structural, and auditability invariants. Probabilistic
freedom exists only within these normative boundaries.
Auditability in probabilistic domains is defined differently than in deterministic ones. Reconstruc-
tion does not aim to identify a unique execution trace, but to verify that an observed outcome
lies within the admissible outcome space defined by active contracts and governance policies.
Probability distributions, when specified, are subject to verification rather than assumption.
Probabilistic execution domains are particularly suited for exploratory computation, optimization,
learning, and search processes. They enable the system to explore a space of possible field
evolutions without prematurely collapsing execution into a single trajectory. Importantly, such
exploration remains governed, auditable, and isolated from deterministic domains unless explicitly
composed.
Transition into or out of a probabilistic execution domain is a governed act. Entry requires
activation of contracts that permit bounded divergence, while exit may require projection
or consolidation mechanisms if interaction with deterministic domains is anticipated. These
transitions preserve execution semantics while reconfiguring governance obligations.
By defining probabilistic execution domains as governed spaces of admissible variability, this
chapter establishes probability as a controlled execution regime rather than an implementation
artifact. This formulation enables rigorous coordination with deterministic domains and prepares
the ground for hybrid execution patterns and cross-domain interaction developed in subsequent
chapters.

3 Coordination Between Deterministic and Probabilistic Do-
mains

The coexistence of deterministic and probabilistic execution domains within a single governed
field system requires explicit coordination mechanisms. Without such mechanisms, interaction
between regimes would risk undermining determinism guarantees or trivializing probabilistic
exploration. This chapter formalizes coordination as a governance-layer process that preserves
the integrity of both execution regimes.
Coordination is defined as the regulated interaction between execution domains operating
under different execution modes. Deterministic and probabilistic domains are never implicitly
composable. Any interaction between them must be explicitly authorized through governance
configuration, compositional interfaces, and boundary contracts.
The fundamental principle of coordination is non-contamination. Probabilistic variability must
not propagate into deterministic domains in a way that violates their equivalence guarantees.
Conversely, deterministic constraints must not collapse probabilistic domains into degenerate
execution regimes. Coordination mechanisms ensure that each domain retains its normative
identity.
One common coordination pattern is asymmetric interaction. Probabilistic domains may supply
candidate field configurations, optimization results, or exploratory outcomes to deterministic
domains through projection or selection interfaces. Deterministic domains may consume such
results only after they have been filtered, validated, or canonicalized under deterministic contracts.
Another pattern is staged execution. A system may alternate between probabilistic and determin-

istic phases, where exploration occurs in probabilistic domains and verification or consolidation
occurs in deterministic domains. Transitions between phases are governed acts that activate or
deactivate relevant contract sets and redefine admissibility constraints.
Boundary contracts play a central role in coordination. These contracts specify admissible
transformations at the interface between deterministic and probabilistic domains. They may
enforce selection criteria, equivalence reduction, bounded variability, or statistical constraints.
Boundary contracts ensure that interaction preserves the guarantees of both sides.
Auditability across coordinated domains is preserved by maintaining explicit separation of regimes.
Execution traces within each domain remain reconstructible according to their respective audit
definitions. Cross-domain interaction is auditable at the boundary by verifying that all transfers
satisfied active boundary contracts.
Importantly, coordination mechanisms do not arbitrate execution outcomes. They do not choose
which probabilistic trajectory is “best” or enforce convergence within probabilistic domains.
Selection, optimization, or decision-making occurs outside coordination itself, typically at higher
governance or orchestration layers.
By formalizing coordination between deterministic and probabilistic execution domains, this
chapter establishes a rigorous framework for hybrid field-native computation. Determinism and
probabilism become complementary execution regimes whose interaction is explicit, governed, and
auditable. This framework enables complex computational workflows that combine exploration,
optimization, and verification without compromising foundational guarantees.

4 Execution Mode Transitions and Hybrid Workflows
Hybrid field-native systems often require execution to move between deterministic and proba-
bilistic regimes over time. This chapter formalizes execution mode transitions as governed acts
and introduces hybrid workflows as structured compositions of execution phases operating under
distinct governance obligations.
An execution mode transition is defined as a governance-level reconfiguration of an execution
domain that changes the active execution mode, contract set, or admissibility constraints without
altering underlying execution semantics. Transitions do not interrupt execution dynamics; they
redefine the normative envelope within which execution proceeds.
Transitions are admissible only if they preserve all invariants required by both the source and
target execution modes. This typically involves boundary verification steps such as equivalence
reduction, canonicalization, or consolidation of field configurations. These steps ensure that
obligations imposed by the target mode are satisfied at the moment of transition.
Hybrid workflows are defined as ordered or structured compositions of execution phases, each
phase operating under a distinct execution mode. A common pattern consists of an exploratory
probabilistic phase followed by a deterministic consolidation phase. Other patterns include
iterative alternation between modes, parallel probabilistic exploration feeding a deterministic
verifier, or staged execution with progressively tightening determinism constraints.
Governance policies specify which transitions are permitted, under what conditions they may
occur, and which boundary contracts must be enforced. Policies are declarative and evaluated
at designated governance checkpoints. There is no implicit or automatic transition between
execution modes; all transitions are explicit and auditable.
Hybrid workflows preserve auditability by maintaining regime separation across phases. Each
phase is auditable according to its execution mode, and transitions are auditable as boundary
events. The resulting system-level audit trace consists of phase-local traces linked by verified
transition points rather than a single monolithic execution history.

Importantly, execution mode transitions do not resolve nondeterminism or select outcomes. They
regulate when and how such resolution may occur by activating contracts that impose equivalence
or convergence requirements. Decision-making remains external to execution governance and
may be performed by orchestration layers or human operators.
By formalizing execution mode transitions and hybrid workflows, this chapter establishes a
temporal coordination framework for field-native computation. Deterministic and probabilistic
regimes become phases of a coherent computational process rather than competing models. This
framework prepares the ground for system-level orchestration, where multiple hybrid workflows
are coordinated across domains and infrastructure.

From Execution Regimes to System Orchestration
The preceding chapters have established deterministic and probabilistic execution domains as
governed execution regimes, formalized their coordination, and defined explicit mechanisms for
regime transitions and hybrid workflows. Together, these constructs elevate execution modes
from local execution properties to system-level governance instruments.
At this point, execution regimes are no longer isolated concerns of individual domains. They
become components of larger computational processes that unfold across time, domains, and
infrastructures. Coordinating such processes requires a perspective that extends beyond individual
domains or workflows and addresses system-wide structure, lifecycle, and interaction.
This transition marks the boundary between execution coordination and system orchestration.
Execution regimes define *how* computation may evolve within a domain. System orches-
tration defines *how multiple governed executions coexist, interact, and progress collectively*
toward higher-level objectives. Orchestration operates over domains, workflows, and governance
configurations rather than over operators or execution states.
The Quantum Virtual Machine thus emerges not merely as a governance engine, but as a control
plane for field-native computation. It admits domains, assigns execution modes, governs transi-
tions, and composes hybrid workflows into coherent system behavior. Importantly, orchestration
does not subsume execution; it arranges and coordinates it without altering its intrinsic semantics.
By moving from execution regimes to system orchestration, the architecture of QFC gains
temporal, structural, and organizational coherence. Deterministic verification, probabilistic
exploration, auditability, and isolation become orchestrated capabilities rather than isolated
features. This shift prepares the ground for treating QVM as a field operating system—a layer
responsible for system-scale coordination, resource governance, and lifecycle management of
field-native computation.
The next document therefore addresses system-level field orchestration explicitly, formalizing
QVM as a control plane that coordinates governed execution at scale while preserving the
foundational guarantees established throughout this book.
